# Part: P1-1 Chassis Body
This is the part of the mechanical assembly that everything bolts down to.

**As of 2026-01-13:** This is a 3D printed part, and I had to split it into two pieces since it didn't fit in my print area. There is too much dimensional error in the print. Having it in two pieces isn't ok, and having it made of plastic is probably not OK either. 

 The pieces that mount on this chassis need to be really well aligned, and stable in their positioning, so the chassis body needs to be a reliable source of 'dimensional truth' that all other parts can rely on. 
 
 In the future I should use a piece of T-Slot rail to do this job. Plastic changes its dimensions too much with temperature and humidity.
