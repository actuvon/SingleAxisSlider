The 6.5mm hole ended up being my favorite. Too small a hole, and you get the excess plastic melt going in the hole at the bottom, forcing you to chase with a tap.

Note: The 4.95mm hole ended up printing smaller. I couldn't fit the M5 bolt in there. Should probably design the hole at 5mm exactly, even though the bolt is 4.85mm. That's the amount of shrinkage, I guess.
